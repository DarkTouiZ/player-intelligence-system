Notes:
The numbers and outputs shown in the notebook cells do not correlate directly to the execution order because some cells were run multiple times or skipped during experimentation. The code order is correct, but the outputs may appear out of sequence.

This notebook contains:
- Simple XGBoost modeling
- Tree-Based Stacking Ensemble modeling
