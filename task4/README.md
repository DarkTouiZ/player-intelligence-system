For Task 4 (Game Title Detection), please note that the outputs shown here may not align perfectly with the current code. This is because several new methods and approaches were experimented with but were ultimately unsuccessful, leading us to revert to the previous code version that had produced the best results. However, it is no longer possible to re-run this previous code to exactly reproduce those results, as the available compute units for the A100 GPU have been exhausted. Therefore, please be aware that there may be discrepancies between the code and the results in this repository.
